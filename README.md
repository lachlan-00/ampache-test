# Ampache documentation server

To create a standard for documentation, translations and changes i've been working on a template server

To use this server you can restore the database and use as a normal server.

Media is not included but available from public sources.

## Usernames and passwords

All users are using `demodemo` as their password so don't put this server on the internet!

* admin
* demo
* user
* generic

## Media used in this test

All the music has been taken from archive.org and should continue to be available if you want to test things with media.
